# Stacking-Algorithm-ML

This project compares the performance of basic machine learning algorithms, ensemble methods, and the stacking technique on the classic Iris dataset. The goal is to evaluate and compare the accuracy of different classification approaches.

load_data.py
Loads and visualizes the Iris dataset.

basic_models.py
Trains and evaluates basic machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM).

ensemble_methods.py
Applies ensemble learning techniques (Bagging, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Voting Classifier).

stacking_model.py
Implements the stacking classifier and evaluates its performance.

final_comparison.py
Displays the final accuracy comparison and conclusion.

Required Libraries:-
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
